    <h1>Pork Humba</h1>
    <img src="../img/Pork-Humba.jpg" alt="Pork Humba" width="310" height="310">
    <p>Chinese-Filipino cuisine has been a part of our culture for decades. Since pre-colonial times when traders used
        to dock on our shores, the Chinese have shared with us not only their barter and bargaining practices, but also
        their cooking. Dishes like pancit, lumpia, and mami are some examples of traditional Chinese dishes that have
        been given a Filipino spin. Humba is yet another example of Chinese cuisine’s integration into Filipno culture.
        Initially, this pork dish was actually based off of the Chinese hong ma or hong ba –– red braised pork belly.
